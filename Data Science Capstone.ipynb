    "In the past several years there has been a large increase in the number of \"foodies\" (A foodie is a person who has an ardent or refined interest in food and who eats food not only out of hunger but due to their interest or hobby[1]). \"The food marketing system, including food service and food retailing, supplied about $1.46 trillion worth of food in 2014.\"[2] This increase has pushed cities to develop their restaurant industry to include a diverse range of restaurants from all over the world. I would like to explore several cities in the U.S. and compare them based on the diversity of restaurants and those restaurants' ratings. For example, does Baltimore have an equal number of Afghan and Chinese restaurants and how does that compare to Seattle? This exploration will be useful for foodies looking to travel to cities on their next adventure or for the cities looking to bring in more tourism. \n"

Then I will get the city's latitude and longitude from the same data set and use this to get the venue data from Foursquare. I will list the venues by category and refine by restaurants only. Then I will one hot encode the restaurants and get their mean and frequency. I will compare this data for the three cities and map the different types of venues for each city. Ideally, the data will clearly point to a city by having many more types of restaurants than another. "
